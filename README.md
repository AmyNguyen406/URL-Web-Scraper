# URL-Web-Scraper
Web scraper built using BeautifulSoup in Python. 

This Web scraper pulls all of the unique links from a webpage and returns them as a list of absolute URIs in a CSV file. Furthermore, the HTML code for the webpage is extracted and a formatted version of it is exported as a text file.

To change which webpage is scraped go to the main() method and change the URL  inside the scrape() method. [Line 99]
